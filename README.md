# Optimized-NOx-Prediction-with-SVR
This project uses Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict NOx emissions from gas turbines, utilizing operational and environmental data. By applying optimized pre-processing and hyperparameter tuning, it achieves high accuracy in emission prediction, supporting environmental monitoring and compliance.
